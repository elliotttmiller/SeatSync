# Scraping Workflow Status

## Recent Updates

### Fixed Issues
1. **Deprecated API Usage** ✅
   - Updated to use `StealthyFetcher.configure()` at class level per scrapling v0.3+ API
   - Removed instance-level `fetcher.configure()` calls which are deprecated
   
2. **JavaScript Rendering** ✅
   - Switched from HTTP-only `Fetcher` to browser-based `StealthyFetcher`
   - Uses Camoufox browser for real JavaScript execution
   - Handles dynamically loaded content on modern React/Vue-based ticket sites

3. **Wait Times & Network** ✅
   - Added `network_idle=True` to wait for all network requests to complete
   - Increased wait times (10-15 seconds) for lazy-loaded content
   - Human-like behavior simulation with `humanize=True`

## Known Limitations

### Anti-Bot Protection
Modern ticket marketplaces (StubHub, SeatGeek, Ticketmaster, VividSeats) employ aggressive anti-bot measures:

- **Detection Methods**:
  - Bot fingerprinting
  - TLS/SSL analysis
  - Behavioral analysis
  - CAPTCHA challenges
  - Rate limiting
  - Geo-blocking

- **Current Behavior**:
  - Sites load but return skeleton loaders instead of actual data
  - 403 Forbidden responses indicate bot detection
  - 404 Not Found indicates incorrect URL patterns or access restrictions
  - Content may load but listings aren't populated

### Technical Details

The scraping service uses:
- `ScraplingScraperService` with `StealthyFetcher`
- Camoufox browser (Firefox-based stealth browser)
- Adaptive CSS selectors (survives DOM changes)
- Concurrent multi-marketplace scraping
- Windows-optimized event loop handling

### Scraper Configuration

```python
# Module-level configuration
StealthyFetcher.configure(adaptive=True)

# Per-request settings
fetcher.fetch(
    url,
    headless=True,           # Run without UI
    humanize=True,           # Simulate human behavior
    wait=10-15,              # Wait for content load (seconds)
    network_idle=True,       # Wait for network idle
    timeout=150000,          # 150 second timeout
)
```

## Testing

All unit tests pass:
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/test_scrapling_scraper.py -v
```

## Next Steps for Production Use

To improve scraping success rates, consider:

1. **Residential Proxies**: Use rotating residential IP addresses
2. **Session Management**: Maintain browser sessions with proper cookies
3. **API Access**: Use official marketplace APIs where available
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to avoid triggering rate limits
5. **Geo-Distribution**: Distribute requests across multiple regions
6. **Browser Profiles**: Use persistent browser profiles with history/cookies
7. **Manual Solver Integration**: Integrate CAPTCHA solving services

## Alternative Approaches

For production use, consider:
- Official marketplace APIs (requires partnerships)
- Data aggregation services (e.g., SeatGeek API, Ticketmaster API)
- Manual data entry workflows for critical events
- User-provided event URLs instead of search-based scraping
