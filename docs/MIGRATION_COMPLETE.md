# ✅ Scrapling Migration Complete

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY  
**Commit:** a9d3fab

---

## Summary

Successfully migrated SeatSync to use **Scrapling exclusively** for all web scraping operations. All old scraping implementations have been removed, and Scrapling is now fully integrated end-to-end with the Streamlit application.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Old Scraping Code ❌

**Deleted Files:**
- `backend/app/services/enhanced_scraping.py` (612 lines, 20,888 bytes)
  - Old HTTP-based scraper with custom proxy rotation
  - Complex rate limiting and fingerprint randomization
  - BeautifulSoup-based parsing
  
- `backend/app/services/advanced_ticket_scraper.py` (648 lines, 24,578 bytes)
  - Old Playwright-based scraper
  - Custom stealth scripts
  - Manual anti-detection implementation

**Total Removed:** 1,260 lines of legacy code

### 2. Simplified Scraping Service ✂️

**File:** `backend/app/services/scraping_service.py`

**Changes:**
- **Removed** all fallback logic (Playwright → HTTP)
- **Removed** feature flag complexity (USE_SCRAPLING)
- **Removed** conditional initialization paths
- **Simplified** to Scrapling-only implementation
- **Added** `adaptive` parameter support
- **Updated** capabilities list to reflect Scrapling features

**Before:** 240 lines  
**After:** 140 lines  
**Reduction:** 42% less code

**Key Changes:**
```python
# OLD: Complex fallback system
if USE_SCRAPLING:
    try Scrapling
    else try Playwright
        else try HTTP
            
# NEW: Simple, direct
Initialize Scrapling or fail with clear error
```

### 3. Streamlit App Integration 🎨

**File:** `streamlit_app.py`

**Updates:**
- ✅ Removed old `enhanced_scraping` import
- ✅ Added `SCRAPLING_AVAILABLE` status check
- ✅ Updated UI branding to "Scrapling-Powered"
- ✅ Added adaptive tracking checkbox (🎯 killer feature!)
- ✅ Expanded marketplace support to 4 platforms
- ✅ Added Scrapling installation guidance in UI
- ✅ Updated status indicators and help text
- ✅ Modified `run_scraping()` to pass adaptive parameter

**New Features in UI:**
```python
# Adaptive tracking checkbox
adaptive_mode = st.checkbox(
    "🎯 Use Adaptive Tracking",
    help="Enable if website structure has changed!"
)

# Support for all 4 marketplaces
["StubHub", "SeatGeek", "Ticketmaster", "VividSeats"]
```

### 4. Requirements Update 📦

**File:** `backend/requirements.txt`

**Before:**
```python
# Advanced web scraping
playwright>=1.40.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
lxml>=5.0.0
# Scrapling - optional
# Uncomment to use: scrapling[all]>=0.3.7
```

**After:**
```python
# Advanced web scraping - Scrapling (REQUIRED)
scrapling[all]>=0.3.7
# Note: After installing, run: scrapling install
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Scrapling

```bash
pip install "scrapling[all]>=0.3.7"
scrapling install
```

This will:
- Install Scrapling and all dependencies
- Download required browsers (Chromium, Firefox)
- Set up fingerprinting capabilities

### 2. Run Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 3. Test Scraping

1. Navigate to "🕷️ Data Collection & Scraping"
2. Select marketplace (StubHub, SeatGeek, etc.)
3. Enter search query (e.g., "Lakers")
4. Optionally enable "🎯 Use Adaptive Tracking"
5. Click "🚀 Start Scraping"

---

## How to Use

### Basic Scraping

```python
from backend.app.services import scrape_tickets

# Scrape StubHub
result = await scrape_tickets(
    marketplace="stubhub",
    search_query="Lakers tickets"
)

print(f"Found {result['count']} listings")
```

### Adaptive Scraping (Killer Feature!)

```python
# If website structure changed, use adaptive mode
result = await scrape_tickets(
    marketplace="stubhub",
    search_query="Lakers tickets",
    adaptive=True  # Finds elements automatically!
)
```

### All Marketplaces

```python
marketplaces = ["StubHub", "SeatGeek", "Ticketmaster", "VividSeats"]

for marketplace in marketplaces:
    result = await scrape_tickets(
        marketplace=marketplace,
        search_query="Lakers tickets"
    )
    print(f"{marketplace}: {result['count']} listings")
```
