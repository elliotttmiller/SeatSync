# Before & After: SeatSync Scraping Workflow

## Visual Comparison

### ❌ BEFORE: Complex and Error-Prone

```python
# Multiple imports needed
from app.services.advanced_ticket_scraper import AdvancedTicketScraper

# Manual initialization
scraper = AdvancedTicketScraper()
initialized = await scraper.initialize()

# Error handling required
if not initialized:
    raise Exception("Scraper not initialized")

# Manual routing
if marketplace.lower() == 'stubhub':
    result = await scraper.scrape_stubhub(search_query=query)
elif marketplace.lower() == 'seatgeek':
    result = await scraper.scrape_seatgeek(search_query=query)
else:
    raise Exception(f"Unknown marketplace: {marketplace}")

# Manual cleanup required
await scraper.cleanup()

# Type errors when Playwright not installed!
# NameError: name 'BrowserContext' is not defined
```

**Problems:**
- 🔴 15+ lines of boilerplate
- 🔴 Manual initialization & cleanup
- 🔴 Type errors on import
- 🔴 No automatic fallbacks
- 🔴 Complex error handling
- 🔴 Easy to forget cleanup

---

### ✅ AFTER: Simple and Robust

```python
# Single import
from backend.app.services import scrape_tickets

# One line to scrape!
result = await scrape_tickets(marketplace="stubhub", search_query="Lakers")

# That's it! ✨
# - Automatic initialization
# - Automatic fallback (Playwright → HTTP)
# - Automatic cleanup
# - Proper error handling
# - Works even without Playwright
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 1-2 lines of code (90% less!)
- ✅ Automatic everything
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Resource management handled

---

## Error Messages: Before vs After

### ❌ BEFORE
```
NameError: name 'BrowserContext' is not defined. Did you mean: 'range'?
```
**Problem:** Cryptic, no solution provided

### ✅ AFTER
```
Failed to initialize scraper. Playwright may not be installed. 
Run: pip install playwright && playwright install chromium

Falling back to HTTP-based scraping with limited capabilities...
```
**Solution:** Clear, actionable, with automatic fallback

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Price Check

**❌ Before (15 lines):**
```python
from app.services.advanced_ticket_scraper import AdvancedTicketScraper
import asyncio

async def check_prices():
    scraper = AdvancedTicketScraper()
    initialized = await scraper.initialize()
    
    if not initialized:
        print("Failed to initialize")
        return None
    
    try:
        result = await scraper.scrape_stubhub(search_query="Lakers")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None
    finally:
        await scraper.cleanup()

asyncio.run(check_prices())
```

**✅ After (3 lines):**
```python
from backend.app.services import scrape_tickets

result = await scrape_tickets("stubhub", "Lakers")
print(f"Found {len(result['listings'])} listings")
```

### Example 2: Multi-Marketplace Comparison

**❌ Before (40+ lines):**
```python
from app.services.advanced_ticket_scraper import AdvancedTicketScraper

async def compare_prices():
    scraper = AdvancedTicketScraper()
    
    if not await scraper.initialize():
        return None
    
    results = {}
    
    try:
        # StubHub
