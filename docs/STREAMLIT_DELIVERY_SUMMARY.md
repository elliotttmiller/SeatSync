## Integration Points

### Backend Services (Ready to Wire Up)
The Streamlit app is structured to easily connect to real backend services:

```python
# Current (Mock Data)
def run_scraping(marketplace, query):
    # Generate mock data
    return mock_results

# Production (Real Scraping)
def run_scraping(marketplace, query):
    scraping_engine = await get_scraping_engine()
    context = await scraping_engine.create_stealth_context()
    result = await scrape_marketplace(context, marketplace, query)
    return result
```

Similar structure for:
- ML training: Connect to AdvancedStackingEnsemble
- Predictions: Use trained models from ensemble_models.py
- Forecasting: Integrate ProphetDemandForecaster
- Pricing: Use DynamicPricingEngine

### Database Integration
Add database connection for real data:
```python
from app.models.database import async_session

async with async_session() as db:
    # Query historical data
    # Train on real data
    # Store results
```

### API Integration
Connect to marketplace APIs:
```python
from app.services.data_ingestion import AdvancedDataPipeline

pipeline = AdvancedDataPipeline()
await pipeline.initialize_sources()
data = await pipeline.collect_from_stubhub(query)
```

## Next Steps
